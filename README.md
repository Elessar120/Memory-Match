Memory Match
Funtory Unity 3D Test

Hello! This is a short guide.

Level Editor:
•  From Windows/Level Editor, you can add the Level Editor Window to your project. After that, you should set your level's info, such as the number of items (for an 8-piece memory match game, it is equal to 4), the cards' rear-and-front images, and other settings to configure the Unity grid layout group.

•  After doing step 1, you can press the "Create New Level" button to make new level data.

•  For testing each level you desire, you should just write its number and press the "Test Level" button. It will load automatically in edit mode. Note that the levels should be made in sequence for this part to work properly.

•  After testing the level, you can clear the scene by pressing the "Clear Scene" button.

Add New Levels:
•  This game only has one level, but with the level editor, you can create as many as you need. You just need to add buttons to your main menu and assign the method "Set Selected Level" from the class "UI Manager" to them. Then, the player can select the created levels and start playing!

Gameplay:
•  It is simple! Just start playing and match all the pieces before the time runs out by clicking on them.

Finish!
